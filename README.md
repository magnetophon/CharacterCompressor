# CharacterCompressor
A compressor with character.

A bit experimental: It works and sounds wonderfull, but has too many parameters, so is a bit fiddly to use.
Also; I have no idea what to name the parameters, or how to explain a lot of them.

#instalation:
- install faust
- copy the repo
- cd to it
- run faust2jack LazyLimiter.dsp
- run ./LazyLimiter

There is also faust2lv2, faust2alsa, and about 30 more variants.
